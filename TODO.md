# TODO

- Since I haven't used a standalone Ubuntu desktop/laptop in a long time, I
  don't actually know, if my lists of Debian packages that are installed is
  complete. This would need to be checked at some point.
- xmonad in the Ubuntu repositories are not in the version that I would need.
  Therefore it has to be installed from source. Either add this at some point
  or wait until xmonad in version >0.17 is in the official repos.
- Check what kind of graphics card driver needs to be installed on Ubuntu.
- Check what (GTK/Qt) themes need to be installed on Ubuntu.
